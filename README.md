# ExpressJS SQLite Boiler Template

This example is built to show how ExpressJS can be used to teach QLD SATE Digital Solutions.

PHP is a great option and a widely used language with popular frameworks like Laravel or Symfony in the industry. However, teaching PHP only to create and interact with the backend is an unnecessary overhead for students.

If students already have prior knowledge of Javascript, sticking with Javascript by using ExpressJS for the backend can be an excellent way to remove that overhead. ExpressJS is also a very popular framework in the web development space and is part of an up-to-date technology stack.

## Personal Disclaimer

There are smelly code in here - use them as opportunities to explore them with your students.

## Node Packages installed on this repository

- Express
- EJS (HTML templating engine for Express)
- SQLite (SQLite Client for Node.JS Apps)
- SQLite3 (Asynchronous SQLite3 bindings)
- nodemon (Development tool that automatically restarts the node application when changes are made)

If you want to use mySQL instead of SQLite, I recommend mysql2 package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

## What this app does

It has a very simple application that allows the user to interact with Books database with three tables (books, genres, authors).
